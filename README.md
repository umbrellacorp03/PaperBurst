# PaperBurst
PaperBurst is a paper wallet generator for Burst. It is written on Visual Basic and it is only available on Windows for now.

# Instruction
1) Install PaperBurst using the msi installer or simply download the portable version.
2) Launch PaperBurst.exe and 2.1)generate a new wallet (12 or 24 words) or 2.2)type your actual passphrase.
3) Save the pdf where you want on your PC.
4) Print your wallet
5) Fold it and/or cut it the way you want.

Be careful : if your password is a long string or isn't a 12 or 24 words passphrase, the pdf will not correctly render.

Finally, if the wallet was generated using PaperBurst, don't forget to activate it (ie. creating an outgoing transaction from your new wallet to share its publickey to the rest of the network)

# Roadmap
- Encrypted paper wallets, and decrypt them using PaperBurst
- Improve security
- Make PaperBurst Less resource consuming
- Adding the possibility to type your own passphrase (long string and not separate words)
