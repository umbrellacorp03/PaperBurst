2) Launch PaperBurst.exe and 2.1)generate a new wallet (12 or 24 words) or type your actual passphrase. Be careful : if your password is a long string or isn't a 12 or 24 words passphrase, the pdf will not correctly render.
3) Save the pdf where you want on your PC.
4) Print your wallet
5) Fold it and/or cut it the way you want.

Finally, if the wallet was generated using PaperBurst, don't forget to activate it (ie. creating an outgoing transaction from your new wallet to share its publickey to the rest of the network)
